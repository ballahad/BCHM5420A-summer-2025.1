    "Documentation is defined as material that provides official information or evidence or that serves as a record. In the context of bioinformatics, we want to document our code and what it is doing. We also want to document the steps we take to perform an analysis. This allows ourselves and others to reproduce and build upon our work. \n",

    "Documentation is our link to the code we write and the bridge that lets others understand, use, and build upon it. Without it, your code becomes a puzzle, even to you after a few weeks away. Documentation provides transparency, reproducibility, and contributes to the betterment of our bioinformatics tools and research. Whether you're creating an open source project or just trying to remember why you wrote that one weird function, good documentation is how you keep the story straight. It's how you invite collaboration and prevent confusion.\n",

    "Good documentation in the context of research answers the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is your data gathered?\n",
    "- What variables did you use?\n",
    "- How did you use code to clean/analyze your data?\n",
    "\n",

    "A few (but not all) of the areas where you will want to supply good documentation is when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Documenting your individual code functions and scripts.\n",
    "2. Documenting your code repository with a README or a tool with an online docs source. (ie. Nextflow docs)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use consistent formatting. There are specific documentation styles, such as ***Roxygen2*** format in R,  ***docstrings*** in Python, or ***JSDoc*** in JavaScript.  It's best to use standard documentation practices when contributing code to an existing repository, and make sure it is consistent with the current documentation. For your own work, you can pick your style that works best for you and stick with it. Pick whatever is simplest for you and that you will do every time.\n",

For example, the `bug` label designates an issue or pull request (PR) is addressing a problem with the functioning of the code, an `enhancement` label is a suggestion for a new feature or improvement, and `good first issue` categorizes an issue as being ideal for first time contributors to resolve.

A \"fork\" allows you to make a copy of the code so that you can edit and safely experiment with changes so as not to affect the original codebase. If you were to `git clone` or copy someone's repo, make edits, then push those edits back into their repository you would be prevented from adding your changes. Performing the same steps on a ***fork*** of someone's repo allows you to safely add the changes and give the original author a chance to first review your edits before approving them to be added (ie. make a PR). You can think of the process of forking as editing a word document with \"track changes\" on instead of directly changing someone's document. Once you have *your* copy of the repo you are trying to edit on GitHub under your account, you can proceed to make a local copy of it on your computer using the `git clone` command we covered in lecture 2. Now you can edit and test the code without worrying about breaking the original!\n",

    "\n",
    "- RMarkdown / Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "    - This allows you to combine code, results, and narrative text in a single, reproducible document. These are great for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and small projects.\n",
    "    - The downside is that these are language-specific (although you can mix R and Python code) and harder to scale across multiple tools or pipelines.\n",
    "- Note-taking apps (e.x., OneNote, Notion, Obsidian):\n",
    "    - Flexible and easy to use for daily notes, troubleshooting logs, or progress updates\n",
    "    - Once consideration is the sensitivity of the information you are recording. Ensure that sensitive data is not put on platforms where data is stored externally.\n",
    "    - These often aren't as nice for tracking code compared to markdown formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the platform, keep things searchable, dated, and version-controlled. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Include sufficient documentation \n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to write down every detail, but try to document any errors you encountered, and how you solved them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep track of file paths and the directories where you performed your analyses. \n",
    "- Keep track of the conda environments and tools used in your analysses\n",
    "- Keep track of result findings\n",
    "- Keep track of where input and output data is stored.\n",
    "- Keep track of what scripts you made and how they were used in your analysis and where they are stored. \n",
