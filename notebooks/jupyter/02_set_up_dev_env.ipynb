Examples of popular IDEs include Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio Codium (open source), RStudio, PyCharm, and Eclipse. \n",

Once the shell receives the command `ls` from terminal, it will convert this command into a kernel-understandable form and pass it to the *kernel*. The kernel bridges the shell and *internal hardware* of a computer, like the CPU & RAM, and will load the `ls` binary into RAM, schedules the process to run on CPU, and set up a standard output/ result (which will be passed back to you in terminal). The kernel and `ls` program interact to retrieve directory information from disk and voil√†! A list of files in the current directory appears in terminal. \n",

If only you had a portable mini version of your kitchen.. Enter Docker. Imagine the cookie is some software you are trying to get working and the ingredients that go into successfully ~~baking~~ making it will vary from system to system. Docker is a stripped down, mini, virtual OS that shares the kernel of your actual [OS](#components-of-a-computer) (if it is linux, otherwise virtualizes a linux kernel) but does not interfere with the rest of it. In this way, Docker *containerizes* everything you would need to perfectly reproduce the successful installation of your software applications. \n",

In the nextflow container, ENTRYPOINT [\"nextflow\"] does not start an interactive shell but rather runs nextflow immediately. Usually, you could use `-it` to start an **i**nteractive **t**erminal in `docker run -it nextflow/nextflow` ***if*** the ENTRYPOINT was not specified to auto-run a program. Since the nextflow container is hardwired to immediately run nextflow, we need to override this behaviour with `--entrypoint /bin/bash`.

How could you answer it with bioinformatic skills? Do you have access to enough data & metadata to answer this question? The research question you select will provide an opportunity to apply the bioinformatic principles and techniques covered throughout BCHM5420/NEUR5420, like interacting with your remote GitHub repository for your bioinformatic project through VS Code.
