# BCHM5420A-summer-2025

Welcome to the summer session of graduate studies in Advanced Bioinformatics at the University of Lethbridge!

This course is structured in a workshop format that guides students from formulating a translational medicine research question through to communication of results while learning best practices for bioinformatic project management and reproducibility. By the end of this course, students will be able to: 

- Comfortably run a Nextflow pipeline 

- Answer an important research question by analyzing and interpreting pipeline results   

- Effectively manage a bioinformatics analysis through code repositories using [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles.
